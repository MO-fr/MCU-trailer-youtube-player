# Top 10 Highest Rated MCU Trailers 🔥🎥

This project is a simple webpage that showcases the **Top 10 Highest-Rated Trailers** from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It allows users to cycle through the trailers using "Next" and "Back" buttons, enhancing the user experience by providing easy navigation between videos.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Layout** 📱: The webpage is built with a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Video Cycling** 🔄: Users can cycle through a list of 10 MCU trailers using "Next" and "Back" buttons.
- **Styled Buttons** 🎨: The buttons are designed with hover effects and a dynamic scale transformation to enhance user interaction.
- **Embedded YouTube Videos** ▶️: The MCU trailers are embedded from YouTube for easy streaming.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to enhance the visual appeal, including button styling, video container, and background colors.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the logic of cycling through the trailers and updating the video player dynamically.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The webpage embeds a YouTube video in an `<iframe>` element.
2. A list of MCU trailer URLs is stored in an array in the JavaScript file.
3. Users can click on the "Next" or "Back" buttons to navigate through the videos.
4. The video player is updated by changing the `src` attribute of the iframe to the corresponding trailer URL from the array.
